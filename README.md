## Description

TextaPad is a text editor PWA that utilizes webpack, @babel, JavaScript, Node.js, HTML, and CSS. The app can be used online or offline, and can be installed locally on your machine.

My motivation for this project was to learn more about Progressive Web Apps and how they function. This was an extremely eye opening project as it demonstrated how we can utilize service workers to achieve offline capabilities.
